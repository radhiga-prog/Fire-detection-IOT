🌲🔥 Forest Fire Detection Using IoT – Overview

Forest Fire Detection using IoT is a smart system that uses sensors, microcontrollers, and the internet to detect forest fires early and alert authorities in real time, helping to reduce damage to life, wildlife, and the environment.



🔧 Key Components

1. Sensors

Temperature sensor – detects abnormal heat

Smoke/Gas sensor (MQ-2/MQ-135) – detects smoke or harmful gases

Flame sensor – detects fire flames

Humidity sensor – low humidity indicates higher fire risk



2. Microcontroller

Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32

Collects data from sensors and processes it



3. Communication Module

Wi-Fi / GSM / LoRa

Sends data to cloud or authorities



4. Cloud Platform

ThingSpeak / Firebase / AWS IoT

Stores data and shows real-time monitoring



5. Alert System

SMS, mobile app notification, email, or alarm





⚙️ Working Principle

1. Sensors continuously monitor forest conditions


2. If temperature rises or smoke is detected beyond a threshold


3. The microcontroller identifies fire risk


4. Data is sent to cloud via internet


5. Alerts are sent instantly to forest officials




✅ Advantages
